<h1>UM... and UH...</h1>
<li>Whenever the person says "um..." or "uh..." as if he is thinking of what to say.</li>
<li><b>When you replay the selection in the interface, you should be able to clearly hear ONLY the "um..." or "uh..." sound!!! Here is how you do it:</b></li>
<li>1. Begin by setting the END TIME (note: really END TIME, not START TIME) of a new annotation to where you think the "um..." or "uh..." starts. Set the START TIME a second before that. Play the selection. Adjust the END TIME frame by frame until you can hear the FRAME THAT BEGINS the "um..." or "uh..."  Reset the START TIME to that frame.</li>
<li>2. Then reset the END TIME to roughly where you think the "um..." or "uh..." ends. Play the SELECTION and wait until it stops. Then play the video (hotkey "f") again from the end of the selection. If you can hear part of the "um..." or "uh..." when you play the video after the selection, adjust END TIME frame by frame until you find the FRAME THAT ENDS the sound.
<li>Note that it can happen in a split of a second!</li>
<li>For each "um..." or "uh...", do your best to identify the EXACT starting time and the ending time.</li>
<li>Identify ALL instances of "um..." and "uh...".</li>
<li>YOU HAVE TO LISTEN AND LOOK AT THE VIDEOS VERY VERY CAREFULLY</li>
