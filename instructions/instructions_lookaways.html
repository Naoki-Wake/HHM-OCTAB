<h1>LOOK AWAY</h1>
<li>A "look away" is whenever the person's eye gaze is directed away from the camera.</li>
<li>Ignore blinking. If the person looks into the camera --> quickly blinks --> continues to look into the camera, then it is NOT a "look away." If the person looks away from the camera --> quickly blinks --> continues to look away, then the whole period IS a "look away."</li>
<li> If the person looks into the camera --> blinks --> immediately has the eyes away from the camera when eyes are open, then the "look away" STARTS from the frame WHEN YOU CAN SEE the eyes directed away from the camera and ENDS at the last frame WHEN YOU CAN STILL SEE the eyes directed away.</li>
<li>Note that it can happen in a split of a second!</li>
<li>For each "look away," do your best to identify the EXACT starting frame and the ending frame.</li>
<li>Identify ALL instances of "look aways".</li>
<li>You have to look at the videos VERY VERY CAREFULLY FRAME-BY-FRAME (Use left and right arrow keys!!!)</li>
