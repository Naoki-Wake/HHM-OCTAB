Also, a bit of background on why this research is exciting. :)

We are interested in programming robots to help humans in their day-to-day lives. Who wouldn't want a robotic butler that does repetitive chores for them?

Our current research objective is to discover and define actions performed by humans that we might want to program a robot to do! As an example, how exactly do we make a salad? Then given this knowledge, how can we program a robot to make a salad?

Thanks for reading! And happy Turking. ;)
